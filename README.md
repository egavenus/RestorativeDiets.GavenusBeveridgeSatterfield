Repo to accompany article

The script and data that accompanies the academic article, Restorative Diets by Gavenus, Beveridge, and Satterfield

The R Markdown file includes four parts:

(I) The script used to generate and randomly sample from distributions to generate a range of salmon harvest rates consistent with likely restorative diets of coastal First Nations.

(II) The script used to explore how variance in each of the defined variables likely contributes to variance in restorative harvest rates.

(III) The script used to check the range of likely harvest rates against quantitative benchmarks: (A) other estimates of historical, heritage, or preferred rates available in the literature; (B) upper tolerable intake levels for nutrients; and (C) salmon returns.

(IV) The script used to compare the range of restorative harvest rates to contemporary rates of harvest, use, and allocation.

The dataframes include:

eer.dist.csv : dataframe of estimated energy requirements (EER) indexed by age (by year), sex, and activity level

ZooArchRecords.xlsx : original NISP data from McKechnie & Moss 2016 converted to calories for top-15 fish taxa

salmon.kcal.xlsx : caloric content of salmon --different species, different preparations-- from Canadian Nutrient File

AgeDistribution2016.BCWide.xlsx : age distribution from Statistics Canada

LiteratureAmountParameters.xlsx : contemporary estimates of salmon use, harvest, allocation from literature sources

TotalRunCentralCoast : salmon returns to Central Coast Region 2013-2017, Salmon Watershed Project
